Hello! I am Kevin Lanteri Kraeutler, born in Marseille. For over 20 years, I have been working with WordPress in various sectors such as real estate, banking, and culture. Recently, I have ventured into the e-Health sector, where I specialize in early access and e-CRF. My expertise extends beyond WordPress, encompassing development with Python and exploring the opportunities presented by LLM.
